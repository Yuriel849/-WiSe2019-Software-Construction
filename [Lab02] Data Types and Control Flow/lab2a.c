int main()
{
	// Use two for loops, one inside the other.aa
	// The other loop prints each row.
	// The inner loops prints the contents of each row.
	// If it is an odd-numbered row, print the pluses and dashes.
	// If it is an even-numbered row, print the bars and identifiers for each place.
	// Two separate variables, one to represent the row number and the other to represent the column letter.
	// Reduce the row number by one every time the outer loop runs.
	// Increase the column letter by one every time the inner loop runs in an even-numbered row, then reset.
